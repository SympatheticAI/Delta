# Δ-ADSR Breakdown by Measurement Style

Think of this as:
**same four phases, different observables, different failure modes.**

---

## 1. Frequency ADSR — *Locking in time*

| Phase       | What it means physically | Core measurements                       | What it tells you                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Attack**  | Pull-in toward resonance | Pull-in time (T_A^f), capture bandwidth | Basin accessibility, initial compatibility |
| **Decay**   | Snap-to-lock             | Snap time (T_D^f), ζ spike, τ           | Gate presence (GATE-CURVE / GATE-SADDLE)   |
| **Sustain** | Held lock                | Drift σ_S^f, phase noise                | Basin stability, LOW proximity             |
| **Release** | Detune / relax           | Relax time (T_R^f), chirp response      | Memory + reversibility                     |

**Failure signatures**

* Long pull-in → high-order basin
* Snap stalls → saddle instability
* Drift grows → impending cavitation

---

## 2. Amplitude ADSR — *Energy accommodation*

| Phase       | What it means physically | Core measurements            | What it tells you           |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Attack**  | Energy injection         | Rise time (T_A^A), overshoot | Elastic vs brittle response |
| **Decay**   | Compression into plateau | Settle time (T_D^A)          | Internal damping structure  |
| **Sustain** | Steady amplitude         | Variance σ_S^A               | Robustness to perturbation  |
| **Release** | Ring-down                | (T_R^A), decay constants     | Stored energy / memory mass |

**Extra nonlinear metrics**

* (dA/dF) (amplitude–frequency coupling)
* Hysteresis area **H**

**Failure signatures**

* Overshoot → brittle basin
* Asymmetric ring-down → memory scars

---

## 3. Phase ADSR — *Coherence and synchronization*

| Phase       | What it means physically | Core measurements       | What it tells you       |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Attack**  | Phase capture            | Capture time (T_A^\phi) | Synchronizability       |
| **Decay**   | Slip → lock              | Lock time (T_D^\phi)    | Basin smoothness        |
| **Sustain** | Phase coherence          | Jitter σ_S^\phi         | Fine-scale stability    |
| **Release** | Dephasing                | (T_R^\phi), slip rate   | Fragility under release |

**Key derived metrics**

* Phase lag (\phi_{lag})
* Lock range
* Cycle-slip probability

**Failure signatures**

* Phase breaks before amplitude → early hazard signal
* Repeated slips → GATE-SADDLE proximity

---

## 4. Energy / Lyapunov ADSR — *Δ core ledger*

| Phase       | Physical meaning | Core measurements   | Why it matters    |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Attack**  | Energy injection | (dV/dt > 0) slope   | Cost of entry     |
| **Decay**   | Relaxation       | Curvature of (V(t)) | Basin depth       |
| **Sustain** | Metastable hold  | (\dot V \approx 0)  | Lock health       |
| **Release** | Natural descent  | ( \dot V \le 0 )    | Validity of basin |

**Critical rule**
Release **must** show monotone or bounded descent for the basin to be real.

**Failure signatures**

* ( \dot V > 0 ) during Release → forbidden / unstable configuration

---

## 5. Geometry / Topology ADSR — *Shape persistence*

| Phase       | Meaning           | Measurements                  | Insight             |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Attack**  | Pattern formation | Time to recognizable geometry | Basin accessibility |
| **Decay**   | Shape refinement  | Symmetry stabilization        | Internal ordering   |
| **Sustain** | Shape persistence | Variance of geometry          | LOW vs high-order   |
| **Release** | Shape dissolution | Residual geometry             | Memory imprint      |

**Associated fields**

* Cymatic tag
* Chirality χ
* Confinement κ
* Holonomy (360° vs 720°)

---

## 6. Memory / Nonlinear ADSR — *History dependence*

| Phase       | Meaning              | Measurements       | Insight                |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Attack**  | First imprint        | Initial hysteresis | Write sensitivity      |
| **Decay**   | Memory consolidation | Loop tightening    | Basin learning         |
| **Sustain** | Stored memory        | Hysteresis area H  | Memory mass            |
| **Release** | Recall / erasure     | Residual offsets   | Plasticity vs scarring |

---

## How these fit together (important)

* **All ADSRs run simultaneously**
  You never have “just frequency ADSR.” You have a *bundle*.

* **Hazard gates live at phase boundaries**
  Especially:

  * A→D (entry)
  * D→S (capture)
  * S→R (exit)

* **Phase ADSR usually fails first**
  Then frequency
  Then amplitude
  Then geometry
  That ordering itself is a diagnostic.

# Extended Δ-ADSR Substrates (Encyclopedia Draft)

## 0. Canonical Reminder (important framing)

* **ADSR is universal**
* **Metrics are substrate-specific**
* **Hazard gates live at transitions**
* **Release is the only phase that must obey Lyapunov descent**

Everything below respects that.

## 7. Contrast / Order-Parameter ADSR

*(c(t), order, coherence, participation)*

| Phase   | Meaning             | Core metrics            | Diagnostic value           |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Attack  | Order formation     | Rise in contrast Δc/Δt  | Accessibility of structure |
| Decay   | Ordering refinement | Time to stable contrast | Basin smoothness           |
| Sustain | Ordered state       | Variance σ_S^c          | Robustness                 |
| Release | Disorder return     | Relaxation time         | Memory vs plasticity       |

**Failure modes**

* Contrast rises before phase locks → false coherence
* Release stalls → trapped disorder (pathology)

---

## 8. Luminality / Transport ADSR

*(Λ(t), flow, routing, corridors)*

| Phase   | Meaning           | Metrics             | Insight                  |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Attack  | Channel opening   | Time to throughput  | Corridor eligibility     |
| Decay   | Path optimization | ΔT improvement rate | Geodesic settling        |
| Sustain | Stable routing    | Throughput variance | Transport robustness     |
| Release | Channel collapse  | Fade symmetry       | Residual bias / scarring |

**Key flags**

* Fast attack + unstable sustain → filament overload
* Asymmetric release → directional memory

---

## 9. Hazard / Abstention ADSR

*(ζ(t), Θ-gates, veto pressure)*

| Phase   | Meaning             | Metrics       | Why it matters   |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Attack  | Hazard accumulation | dζ/dt         | Entry cost       |
| Decay   | Gate resolution     | ζ peak → fall | Safety margin    |
| Sustain | Guarded operation   | ζ baseline    | Stable viability |
| Release | Hazard dissipation  | Relax slope   | Recovery health  |

**This ADSR is meta**
It often **leads** the others — rising before phase/frequency failure.

## 10. Geometry / Shape ADSR

*(pattern fields, cymatic forms)*

| Phase   | Meaning             | Metrics            | Insight            |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Attack  | Shape nucleation    | Time to tag        | Basin reachability |
| Decay   | Symmetry refinement | Error → ideal      | Internal order     |
| Sustain | Shape persistence   | Geometric variance | LOW compliance     |
| Release | Shape dissolution   | Residual geometry  | Memory imprint     |

**Important**

* Geometry ADSR is discrete-continuous hybrid
* Release residues are often your **best memory signal**

## 11. Topology / Symmetry ADSR

*(chirality, holonomy, confinement)*

| Phase   | Meaning               | Metrics         | Interpretation           |
| ------- | --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Attack  | Topological capture   | Lock time       | Structural admissibility |
| Decay   | Constraint tightening | Sector pruning  | Basin enforcement        |
| Sustain | Topological stability | χ, κ stability  | Identity strength        |
| Release | Constraint release    | Sector survival | Confinement class        |

**Key tests**

* 360° vs 720° loop divergence
* Lone sector vs triad survival

---

## 12. Memory / History ADSR

*(hysteresis, learning, sediment)*

| Phase   | Meaning          | Metrics          | Insight       |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Attack  | First write      | Loop area growth | Sensitivity   |
| Decay   | Consolidation    | Loop tightening  | Learning rate |
| Sustain | Stored memory    | H plateau        | Memory mass   |
| Release | Recall / erasure | Residual offset  | Plasticity    |

This ADSR often **lags** others — that lag is informative.

---

## 13. LOW / Ratio-Space ADSR

*(distance to low-order locks)*

| Phase   | Meaning         | Metrics             | Insight            |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Attack  | Ratio approach  | ΔL/Δt               | Lock accessibility |
| Decay   | Ratio snap      | Time to nearest LOW | Basin depth        |
| Sustain | Ratio stability | L variance          | LOW dominance      |
| Release | Ratio drift     | Exit symmetry       | Structural bias    |

**This one is subtle but powerful**
It’s how you watch **RG thinning in time**, not just statically.

---

## 14. Material / Coupling ADSR *(optional, when available)*

| Phase   | Meaning             | Metrics             | Use              |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Attack  | Coupling activation | LO–TO response      | Entry cost       |
| Decay   | Mode separation     | Split stabilization | Internal routing |
| Sustain | Material lock       | Parameter drift     | Suitability      |
| Release | Relaxation          | Recovery symmetry   | Fatigue          |

Only log this when you *have* the data — it’s not mandatory.
