# Philosophical Spine (Foundational, Non-Overlapping)

Purpose: keep the ontological/epistemic architecture cleanly separated from cosmological mechanics while preserving one unified worldview.

## Inclusion Contract
- Include: ontology, logic emergence, geometric meaning of number, problem/consciousness framing, cross-domain interpretation, falsifier logic.
- Exclude: solver controllers, certification plumbing, packet/file mechanics, and detailed cosmological operator derivations.
- Format: one atomic claim per line; each section has a strict scope.

## 1. Ontological Ground
- P-0001: Pure undifferentiated everything is operationally equivalent to nothing because no distinction can be made.
- P-0002: Distinction is the minimal condition for structure, information, and reality-claims.
- P-0003: The foundational dual appears as presence (Dot/1) and absence-potential (Circle/0).
- P-0004: There is no third foundational option beneath the presence/absence split.
- P-0005: Reality begins as tension between these dual vacua rather than as static substance.

## Additions Rule
- New philosophical entries must be ontology, epistemic law, logical primitive, geometric meaning, or falsifier.
- Cosmological mechanics belongs in the cosmology spine, not this file.
- If an entry mixes both layers, split it into two atomic claims and place each in its proper spine.
- Exclude all claims, receipts, or references from the deprecated LIGO/LIGL campaign.
