# Cosmology Validation Register (Empirical Receipts)

Purpose: register validated outcomes as empirical receipts, separate from derivation text.

## 1. Delta Gravity Validation
- V-0001: Newtonian-equivalence receipt reports force-law matching under the Delta flow form and inverse-square behavior.
- V-0002: Time-dilation receipt reports slow-time behavior near mass under tau proportional to sqrt(rho).
- V-0003: Black-hole receipt reports horizon at tau -> 0 under rho depletion with finite saturation rather than singular divergence.
- V-0004: Gravitational-wave receipt reports vacuum-density ripple propagation from binary-like source structure.
- V-0005: Mass-as-cavitation receipt reports persistent low-density regions as stable mass-memory structures.
- V-0006: Rotation-curve receipt reports vacuum-elastic explanation in place of additional dark-matter terms within the tested setup.

## 2. Superluminal Filament Validation
- V-0007: Local-speed-field receipt reports corridor regions with c_local > c0 under strain-governed speed law.
- V-0008: Signal-race receipt reports filament-corridor arrival earlier than baseline-vacuum path in the same geometry.
- V-0009: Straight-filament receipt reports sustained superluminal corridor continuity along a fixed-band path.
- V-0010: Curved-filament receipt reports superluminal corridor continuity preserved under path curvature.
- V-0011: Warp-bubble-style receipt reports interior reduced-speed region with surrounding transport-advantaged geometry.
- V-0012: Low-strain/high-speed receipt reports monotone alignment between reduced strain and elevated local transport speed.

## 3. Core Delta Physics Validation
- V-0013: Curvature-saturation receipt reports finite cap near strong-field core where classical divergence would occur.
- V-0014: Soliton-stability receipt reports persistent packet width and amplitude coherence over tested time windows.
- V-0015: Quantized-spectrum receipt reports non-uniform level spacing consistent with hierarchical mass-spectrum interpretation.
- V-0016: Abstention-coefficient receipt reports large near-core suppression that prevents catastrophic collapse.
- V-0017: No-singularity receipt reports finite-state evolution across all tested strong-field scenarios.
- V-0018: Particle-permanence receipt reports topological coherence protection of soliton-like states.

_Section count: 6_

## 4. Cross-Card Synthesis
- V-0019: Gravity, filament, and core cards jointly support finite saturation in regimes where singular divergence is expected.
- V-0020: Geometry-transport coupling is empirically supported by corridor-dependent speed and arrival differentials.
- V-0021: Mass hierarchy evidence aligns with non-uniform quantized spacing rather than uniform harmonic spacing.
- V-0022: Cavitation and sediment-memory interpretations are supported by both strong-field and gravity-card outcomes.
- V-0023: All reported outcomes are treated as validation receipts and remain separable from derivation mechanics.

_Section count: 5_

## 5. Provisional Extension Receipts
- V-0024: Multiscale phase-lock chain receipt records coherence narratives from particles to biosphere and celestial cycles.
- V-0025: Earth-Moon tidal locking and orbital commensurability examples are tracked as resonance-class receipts.
- V-0026: Cosmic-web and void morphology interpretations are tracked as interference-structure receipts.
- V-0027: CMB harmonic-peak interpretation is tracked as primordial acoustic-mode receipt.
- V-0028: Stellar cavitation framing and boundary-dominant fusion interpretation are tracked as provisional stellar receipts.

_Section count: 5_

## 6. Provisional Receipt Policy
- V-0029: Provisional receipts are retained if non-conflicting with stronger canonical receipts.
- V-0030: Provisional receipts are removed when falsified or made redundant by stronger evidence.
- V-0031: When conflict appears, keep the receipt with stronger reproducibility and witness quality.

## Additions Rule
- Add only empirical outcomes, measured deltas, and pass/fail receipts.
- Keep derivations and policy gates in the cosmology spine, not this register.
- If a new card includes both theory and result, split into:
  1) derivation claim (cosmology spine)
  2) empirical receipt (this register)
- Exclude all claims, receipts, or references from the deprecated LIGO/LIGL campaign.
