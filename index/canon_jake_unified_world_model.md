# Jake Unified World Model Canon

Single working file: philosophy + cosmology + validation, merged for additive iteration.

## Unified Policy

- Add anything that does not self-disqualify or conflict with stronger-supported claims.

- Keep claims until they are redundant or falsified.

- If conflict appears, remove the worse-conflicting claim and retain the stronger-supported one.

- Exclude all claims or receipts from the deprecated LIGO/LIGL campaign.

- Split mixed entries into derivation claims and validation receipts when needed.


## Philosophy Layer

## 1. Ontological Ground
- P-0001: Pure undifferentiated everything is operationally equivalent to nothing because no distinction can be made.
- P-0002: Distinction is the minimal condition for structure, information, and reality-claims.
- P-0003: The foundational dual appears as presence (Dot/1) and absence-potential (Circle/0).
- P-0004: There is no third foundational option beneath the presence/absence split.
- P-0005: Reality begins as tension between these dual vacua rather than as static substance.

_Section count: 5_

## 4. LOW As Survival Law
