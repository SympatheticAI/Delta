# Philosophy vs Cosmology Overlap Map

## Keep In Philosophy Spine
- Ontological dual (presence/absence) and first-principles binary emergence.
- ONAL state semantics and their epistemic interpretation.
- Problem definition: bounded frame vs unbounded reference.
- Oscillation diagnostic and consciousness-as-gating interpretation.
- Geometric meaning of number as lock ontology.
- Falsifier logic at the conceptual layer.

## Keep In Cosmology Spine
- Five-field inventory and variational action.
- AFFE equations, MOND regime, cavitation horizons, ringdown/echoes.
- Cosmological expansion/inflation dynamics.
- RG/DAL bridge and quantitative spectral-floor mechanics.
- Delta-based constant recovery and publication packet mechanics.

## Split Rules For Mixed Drafts
- If a sentence contains equations/validators/operators plus metaphysical interpretation, split into:
  1. philosophical claim (this spine)
  2. mechanical claim (cosmology spine)
- Never duplicate the same claim text across both files.
- Reference across files by section title, not by copy-paste.
