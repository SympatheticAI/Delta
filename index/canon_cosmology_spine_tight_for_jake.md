# Cosmology Spine (Tight, Additive, Solver-Minimized)

Purpose: a strict cosmology-forward canon you can keep extending without control-law clutter.

## Inclusion Contract
- Include: ontology, action, field equations, cosmological regimes, observables, falsifier-facing claims.
- Exclude: runtime controllers, certification mechanics, transport auditing, and procedural solver routing unless indispensable for a cosmology claim.
- Format: each claim stays atomic and keeps its source statement ID for chain-of-custody.

## 1. Scope And Inclusion Rule
Keep only cosmological ontology, dynamics, regimes, and observables. Exclude solver/control machinery unless it is structurally required for cosmology claims.

## Additions Protocol (Keep It Tight)
- Add new statements only if they map directly to one of the 13 sections above.
- If a new claim does not fit, create one new section with a one-line scope rule, not a mixed bucket.
- Preserve atomic style: one claim per line, one claim type per sentence.
- Keep equations or regime laws with explicit symbols and threshold conditions.
- Mark open hypotheses explicitly in a dedicated subsection before promotion to core claims.

## Parking Lot (Not Core Yet)
- Any solver/control or certification-specific mechanics that are useful operationally but not constitutive of cosmology.
- Candidate links to runtime stack can be referenced here without polluting the cosmology spine.
