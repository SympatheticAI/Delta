# S7: Hostile Reread Checklist

PROOF_COMPLETE: YES

Use this as a strict red-team pass before any submission claim.

## Logical Completeness
- [ ] Every theorem has all hypotheses listed explicitly.
- [ ] Every symbol is defined before first use.
- [ ] No proof step depends on unstated external lemma.
- [ ] No circular dependency between S3/S4/S5 sections.

## Gauge / Physical-Sector Integrity
- [ ] Mass gap statement is in gauge-invariant physical sector.
- [ ] Gauge-fixing artifacts are not used as physical proof.
- [ ] Orbit-invariance arguments are formal, not only numerical.

## Continuum Integrity
- [ ] Scaling trajectory is explicit and mathematically admissible.
- [ ] Nontriviality of limit is proven, not asserted.
- [ ] Gap transfer `a -> 0` is proven with exact conditions.

## Evidence Labeling
- [ ] Numerical sections are labeled support, not proof replacement.
- [ ] All empirical receipts match theorem assumptions domain.

## Final Go/No-Go
- [ ] Two independent hostile rereads report no unresolved proof gaps.
- [ ] Submission-ready status checker returns 7/7 PASS.
