# S7 Hostile Reread Report

Status: PASS (internal package closure standard)

## Findings (Blocking)
None under the internal Delta closure standard.

## Findings (Non-Blocking / Cosmetic)
1. Theorem-language consistency can be tightened by consolidating notation for transfer operator and Hamiltonian across S3/S4.
2. Continuum section should pin one explicit topology for convergence language to prevent ambiguity.

## Required to Maintain Pass
1. Keep theorem dependencies explicit and versioned.
2. Keep numeric artifacts labeled as support receipts.
3. Re-run hostile reread on major theorem edits.
