G2_floor: PASS - Transverse floor remains strictly positive across tested dressing.
G3_proxy: PASS - Gauge-invariant proxy relations hold in current artifact set.
G5_scaling_identity: PASS - Current scaling identities are internally exact.
G4_orbit_invariance: BLOCKED - No raw gauge-link configuration snapshots found in data/; cannot execute random local gauge-orbit invariance test yet.
ARTIFACT_DUPLICATE_CHECK: INFO - L5_glueball_spectrum.csv is byte-identical to delta_wilson_creutz_proxy.csv.
